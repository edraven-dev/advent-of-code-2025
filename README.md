# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) in Rust.

## Structure

Each day is a separate crate in the workspace:
- `day01/` - Day 1
- `day02/` - Day 2
- ... and so on

## Running

To run a specific day:
```bash
cargo run -p day01
```

To run tests for a specific day:
```bash
cargo test -p day01
```

To run all tests:
```bash
cargo test
```
